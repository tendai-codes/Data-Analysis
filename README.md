# Data Analysis Project Repository

This repository showcases a series of projects exploring tackling various data to discover useful insights and express this through visualizations 

### Projects Overview

1. **Financial Data Analysis and Performance Optimization (R):**  
  Analyzed the financial statements of organization 'X' to assess its overall financial health. This involved calculating key financial metrics such as profit, profit margin, and tax, as well as identifying the best and worst performing months based on profit after tax. The analysis provided valuable insights into the organization's financial performance and helped highlight areas for potential improvement.

2. **Box Office Data Analysis - Highest-Grossing Movies in the US (R):**  
   Analyzed publicly available box office data to identify key trends and patterns among top-grossing movies. Insights revealed the most profitable genres, top-performing studios, and the effect of release timing on revenue performance.

3. **Global Population Trends - World Bank Data Exploration (Python):**  
   Analyzed global datasets on income, fertility rates, and life expectancy. The analysis revealed significant correlations, such as the inverse relationship between income and fertility, and the positive relationship between income and life expectancy, providing insights for policy decisions and resource allocation.

4. **Asset Allocation & Statistical Data Analysis (Python):**  
   Created a function to calculate portfolio returns and assess performance using the Sharpe ratio. This project focused on optimizing asset allocation strategies through statistical analysis of historical data.

5. **Stocks Analysis & Visualization (Python):**  
   Analyzed stock market datasets to understand daily returns and uncover insightful patterns. The analysis involved creating data visualizations that highlighted trends in stock performance over time.
